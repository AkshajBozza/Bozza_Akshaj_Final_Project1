# Bozza_Akshaj_Final_Project1


## Overview
I want to create a Snake game with all the classic rules but with a few extra features.

## Description
This project will function similarly to the classic Snake game. Using arrow keys, you will be able to move the snake sprite, and there will be randomly generated "foods" that upon consumption by the snake, will elongate its length. Additionally, if the snake collides with the borders of the game or hits its own body, the game will end as the player will have lost. There will also be a score shown for each food that the snake consumes. Potentially, there may be a power-up that increases the snake's score without increasing its length or other obstacles that may reduce the score, but the standard version won't have any features that can decrease the score. It will either be a score increase or game over.


## Dependencies
Prerequisites

Windows 10, Pygame, Python (latest edition), and the os library are prerequisites to run the game.
An IDE is preferably best to run the code

Installing
Just download the files in this github all in the same directory. If you are missing a specific image for a sprite in the game, please ensure everything is in the same directory.
There are no other steps required to install, assuming you have met all the dependencies.
You can just open main.py in Python to immediately run the game, or in an IDE, running it will also yield the same result.
(Step-by-step code comments and further instructions will be added post-game creation)

## Help
Ensure that all the image and code files are in the same directory to ensure you have all the images required for the game.
Besides this, no other installation, besides what is in this github, is required for installation.
